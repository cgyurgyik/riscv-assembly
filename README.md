## About
- A collection of functions and algorithms I've implemented using limited RISC-V instructions. 
- Calling conventions follow those of CS 3410. Frame pointer ignored.
- Testing was done with the [Cornell University RISC-V Interpreter](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3410/2019sp/riscv/interpreter/index.html).
